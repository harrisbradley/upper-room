# Product Vision

**Make it simple for anyone to start, organize, and lead meaningful Bible study gatherings.**

## Core Idea

Many people feel called to start a Bible study but never do because:

- Planning feels overwhelming  
- Logistics are unclear  
- Leading feels intimidating  

This product removes those barriers and makes starting a Bible study feel:

> simple, peaceful, and immediately real.

## Transformation

From:
> “I should start a Bible study someday…”

To:
> “My Bible study exists. People are coming.”

## Guiding Principles

- **Simplicity first** — fewer clicks, less friction  
- **Create before login** — remove psychological barriers  
- **Support real ministry** — not just scheduling software  
- **Encourage community** — Scripture encountered together  
- **Calm, prayerful UX** — never noisy or corporate
